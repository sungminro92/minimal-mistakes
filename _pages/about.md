Hello! My name is Sungmin Ro

I'm a designer and a coder currently living in Long Island City, but I call many cities home - Seoul and Seattle.

Growing up in many different cities, I can speak for the true value of multi-cultural experiences and the power of diverse perspectives

I recently graduated with an MFA in Design & Technology at Parsons School of Design, where I learned to utilize the web and various media and technologies to create meaningful and engaging user experiences. I also have a strong background in Visual Designs and Communications from pursuing a BFA in Design from School of Visual Arts.

Coming from a dual background in Design and Development, I am passionate about creating an immersive experiences and interactive environment, both in digital and physical world, using my strengths -- my eyes that look for the well-balanced aesthetics and my strong tendency to create something functional.

My works range:
from visual designs to experience/interaction design,
from prototyping to building interactive installations,
from small visual coding to web programming.

Outside work, I'm a [mother of a mini-schnauzer](https://www.instagram.com/cookee_dawg/), a [crafter of aesthetic wire flowers](https://www.instagram.com/minniemadeny/), and a [collector of manholes](https://www.instagram.com/manholeism/)
