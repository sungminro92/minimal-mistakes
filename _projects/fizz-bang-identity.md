I had so much fun learning Arduino in school.

Here is my simple exploration on connecting Arduino to Processing.

Using a knock sensor, or a blow sensor, Arduino is able to read physical values from a sensor and pass those data to Processing over serial port in order to process visualization accordingly. 

Fun Stuff!
