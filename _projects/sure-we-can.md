Created a series of object-centered products that pokes at the rising challenges and problems as the consequences of the blurred balance between work and life, especially caused by the rise of digital technology. These speculative product designs suggest physical-interaction-oriented methods to help office workers maintain an increased productivity and improve their current workaholic lifestyle for a healthy office-life-balance.

## THE CHALLENGE
How might we reimagine physical patterns of productivity for office workers to maintain a healthy work-life-balance and not to be excessively attached to digital disturbance

## RESEARCH
I began my research from learning more about the real situations of the current environment of the office job. I have interviewed with current students and alumni at Parsons and also those people outside school who must be physically present in the office for their job. The general investigation was to observe and find out how office workers consider the basic breakdown of the total amount of daily productivity performed in the office in relation to their satisfaction over their own accumulated efficiency.

## ANALYZE
Individual interviewee reacted to each questions differently with behavioral variations. In summary of the responses, all of the interviewees work more than their assigned hours with the unspoken pressure to stay in. Approximately 15 minutes of coffee break adds up to three times a day and one hour for lunch was the average among all. In terms of productivity, I’ve had many different answers including interrupted productivity because most of them were having a difficulty to say no to other colleagues while they still liked part of interacting and being communicative with others. On the other hand, one interviewee, Jesse, has mentioned, “I don’t like it when people sitting next to me talk to me through Slack.” This particularly brought my attention to also look into the digital tools that are developed for office productivity and communications.
