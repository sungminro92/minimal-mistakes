## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We started this project from the premise that gene editing had allowed for the  elimination of all diseases. Some consequences of this starting point that informed our  thinking were:

* Increased life expectancy
* Over-population
* Gene editing becomes common-place
* Euthanasia legalized

From here, we started exploring possibilities for objects to create. Influenced by Design  Noir by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, we focused our attention around concepts of  death and sex in this future society. 

For death, we thought about euthanasia machines through the lens of home delivered  kits and the quantified self movement. We explored the possibilities of Ikea-style DIY  kits for killing yourself, on the one hand, and euthanasia “FitBits” on the other. 

For sex, our ideas both surrounded gene editing: character selection style designer  baby catalogs, or sex robots built to look like the person you’d have to procreate with  in order to create a baby you designed. 

It was this last idea that we decided to explore more deeply. To flesh this out a bit,  some of our thoughts surrounding this were: 

* Gene editing would become more commonplace 
* Overpopulation would lead to people having fewer children 
* More emphasis would be placed on having the perfect child 
* Increased social isolation 
* Larger extended family units 
* Less desire to get married or stay with one partner 

This led us to the idea of starting with the genetically engineered baby and working  backwards to construct a sexual partner (sex doll) for the person to procreate with.  While this was an appealing idea to us both, we decided that because of time and  budget constraints we couldn’t do this concept justice in its current form.

Instead, we asked what the bargain version of such a product would be: if you  were unable to afford a full sex robot, what could you get instead to create your ideal  baby? This led to the concept of a home impregnation kit—you’ve already selected all  the features you’d want for your baby, and now you get the genetically modified semen  by mail along with some sort of device you can use to impregnate yourself or  impregnate. 

After looking through some pamphlets and promotional material from IVF companies  we started to see how divorced of sex and sexuality those companies and products  were and thought we should go down that route.  What we ended up with was a simple plastic suppository type applicator, like one  you’d find in a Monistat package. We created a box to hold all of our objects: the  Genetically Modified Cartridges (GMCs), the applicator, instructions, and ice packs to  keep it all cool. 

## Initial & Final Prototype

Our final product improved on these forms but didn’t change all that much about  the direction of it. The biggest changes were to the instructions, where we tried to  make it super clear that what this box was offering was the genetic material to create  exactly the baby you designed, not a possible range of babies based on genetic  material from a father/donor. We’re not entirely sure we got there completely in the end,  but we are definitely closer now than we were before.

Ultimately, we weren’t striving to directly criticize anything explicitly so much as we  wanted to create a product that felt slightly disconcerting or uncanny and touched on  questions surrounding power and control.

We felt that in a world where gene editing was possible and accepted, and  overpopulation was rampant, peoples drive for control would manifest in designing  their babies rather than leave anything up to chance. This of course also opens up the  door for explicit race science, multicultural fetishism, eugenics, and so on.
